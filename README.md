# randomizer
A basic flask app used to prompt discussions about software testability.

## About

The idea for this small app originates with [Hania Abouhelwa](https://github.com/habouhelwa), a QC Engineer, and [myself](https://github.com/ecedmondson), during our shared time working together. 

The point of the app is to prompt people to think about testability, requirements, acceptance criteria, and product behavior. 

You can find this app deployed at https://ed-randomizer.herokuapp.com/
